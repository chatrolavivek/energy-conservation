Group Project for BLDG 6581-Decision Analysis Course at Concordia University


This project addresses the decision analysis alternatives of a potential renovation, in the apartment located on 3605 Saint Urbain Street, Montreal, Quebec, to decrease energy consumption using energy efficiency designs. To select the best decision, we applied several theories to determine the cost savings from using two options: SolarWall and Motion Sensing Lights. After collecting data, the alternatives were branched by creating a decision tree, such decisions were made using the Net Present Worth of each alternative. Alternatives with positive net present worth are likely to generate profit, and are therefore considered for their sensitivity of parameters, utility values and multiple objective approaches.
